// Because C++ is designed to be portable and performant across a wide range of architectures, the language designers did not want to assume a given CPU would be able to efficiently manipulate values that were narrower than the natural data size for that CPU.
// To help address this challenge, C++ defines a category of type conversions informally called the numeric promotions. A numeric promotion is the type conversion of certain narrower numeric types (such as a char) to certain wider numeric types (typically int or double) that can be processed efficiently

//Some widening type conversions (such as char to short, or int to long) are not considered to be numeric promotions in C++ (they are numeric conversions)
