//we want to do something like this 
//std::cout << "b is a " << b << '\n'; // much better


//but we can make only member functions virtual, not friend functions, also if we try
//to override it for base and derived, the operator<< for base will take param base
//and for dervived will take param derived, so it wont be considered an override

//fix 1:

#include <iostream>

class Base
{
public:
	// Here's our overloaded operator<<
	friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Base& b)
	{
		// Call virtual function identify() to get the string to be printed
		out << b.identify();
		return out;
	}

	// We'll rely on member function identify() to return the string to be printed
	// Because identify() is a normal member function, it can be virtualized
	virtual std::string identify() const
	{
		return "Base";
	}
};

class Derived : public Base
{
public:
	// Here's our override identify() function to handle the Derived case
	std::string identify() const override
	{
		return "Derived";
	}
};

int main()
{
	Base b{};
	std::cout << b << '\n';

	Derived d{};
	std::cout << d << '\n'; // note that this works even with no operator<< that explicitly handles Derived objects

	Base& bref{ d };
	std::cout << bref << '\n';

	return 0;
}


//better solution:
#include <iostream>

class Base
{

	// Here's our overloaded operator<<
	friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Base& b)

	// We'll rely on member function print() to do the actual printing

	virtual std::ostream& print(std::ostream& out) const
